## Introduction
This game look like [jeusol.fr](https://www.jeusol.fr/tripeaks) programming in C language.

## Installation
Clone this repository and let's it !

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rmfr35/TriPeak.git
```
## How to play ?
Launch program and enter your choice in the console.

## How it works ?
If your card than you take is valid (-1 or +1 of the current card) in the game you can see the card choose is remplace by '00x' card. 


###### Card is generate 1 from 13

| 2 |  2 | 
| 3 |  3 | 
| 4 |  4 | 
| 5 |  5 |

## Program connect to libraries
To works properly this program `include libraries` available in **game.h** :
```sh
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <windows.h>
#include <unistd.h>
```
> `Don't touch any libraries in this project if you don't wan't a crash !`

## It works with multiplateforms !
We have configure this game to works with linux. 
In fact, we see under which system the program is running to make it more ergonomic !
by using env def more informations at [this site](https://iq.opengenus.org/detect-operating-system-in-c/). `/!\ It make to avoid crash in others systems`

```sh
// Windows system
#ifdef _WIN32
    //code...
#endif

// Unix system
#ifdef __unix__
    //code...
#endif
```

## Program variables
We are using lot of variables in this program. You can see it below with their description

| VARIABLE | TYPE  | DESCRIPTION |

| arraylayer1 | Card | First layer of the game from the top |
| arraylayer2 | Card | Second layer |
| arraylayer3 | Card | Third layer |
| arrayDeck | Card | Reserve deck of the game |

## Program functions
We use differents functions in this program 
| FUNCTION NAME | TYPE  | DESCRIPTION |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| InitializeCard() | int | This function initialize all cards in game |
| shuffle() | void | This function shuffle all cards |
| attribueCards() | void | This function attribue cards in differents layers |
